# Image Encryption Tool

## Description

This project is a simple image encryption tool that uses pixel manipulation techniques to encrypt and decrypt images. By performing operations such as swapping pixel values or applying basic mathematical operations to each pixel, this tool allows users to securely encrypt their images and later decrypt them.

## Features

- Encrypts images using pixel manipulation techniques
- Decrypts images to their original form.
- User-friendly interface for selecting images and entering encryption keys.
- Supports various image formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for the project.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Library for image processing.
- **VSCode**: Integrated development environment (IDE) for coding.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and project collaboration.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash

   git clone <repository-url>

Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
cd image_encryption_tool
Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):

bash
python -m venv env
Activate the Virtual Environment:

On Windows:

bash
.\env\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

bash
source env/bin/activate
Install Required Packages:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
How to Use
Run the Program:

bash
python image_encryption_tool.py
Encrypt an Image:

Select the image file you want to encrypt.

Enter an encryption key or value.

The encrypted image will be saved to the specified location.

Decrypt an Image:

Select the encrypted image file.

Enter the decryption key or value.

The decrypted image will be saved to the specified location.

Example
plaintext
Select an option:

1. Encrypt an Image
2. Decrypt an Image
Enter your choice: 1
Enter the path to the image file: /path/to/image.png
Enter the encryption key: 12345
Image encrypted successfully!
